PyScript is almost like normal Python code. There are only a few things you should do like importing JS library & working with some
functions like Element and lots of unseen by everyone dot functions to build the project.
I'm sure that, by looking at the code you'll understand at least 90% of it.

# To call your PyScript you must use <py-script style="python_code_file_name.py"></py-script>
